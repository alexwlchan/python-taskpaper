Release history
===============

0.2 "It's all linked" (2016-04-09)
**********************************

*  In 0.1a, you set the completion state of a task with ``mark_done()`` and
   ``mark_undone()``.  Move to using attributes only, which is more Pythonic.
*  Rudimentary support for handling links on items with the ``links``
   attribute.

0.1a "Should have been 0.1" (2016-04-05)
****************************************

*  Initial PyPI release.  Supports viewing/editing the tags of a task, and
   viewing/setting the done status.
*  Should have been 0.1, but I screwed up trying to upload 0.1 to PyPI, so
   I called it 0.1a instead.
